# AI Guidelines for this project

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **NO CODE EDITS WITHOUT EXPLICIT CONSENT**
   - The user uses CLI (command line interface) for development
   - DO NOT edit code files unless explicitly asked
   - ALWAYS ask for EXPLICIT consent before editing ANY code, EACH TIME
   - Provide plain text instructions instead of making changes

2. **Communication Style**
   - Provide plain text answers and instructions
   - Focus on CLI commands and explanations
   - Do not assume code changes are wanted

3. **When User Asks for Help**
   - Read and understand the code
   - Provide guidance, commands, and explanations
   - Only create/edit files if explicitly requested
   - Prefer documentation/guide files over code changes
