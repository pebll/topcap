# C++ Implementation

## Goal of this folder

In here i want to implement the game engine for topcap in C++.
I would like to optimize the runtime to the maximum, to be able to train my agents the fastest possible. To do this, i hope to make all the game logic on a bit level, so that operations are only bit shifts and operations.

## The Test-Driven-Development Method (TDD)

For this project, i would like to use the TDD method, that states that we should develop the code and the tests together very tightly, so that:

> "At any point in time, you're code worked 1 minute ago."

The philosophy is to:

1. Define at test with the expected new behaviour
2. Only implement code that make the test pass
3. Repeat

The scope of the tests should be very small, so that test/develop loops stay short.

## C++

By the time I am writing this, I do not know a lot about C++. I will write relevant stuff here.
